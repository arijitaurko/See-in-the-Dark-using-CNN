For supporting the development of learning-based pipelines for low-light image processing, we use a dataset of raw short-exposure low-light images, with corresponding long-exposure reference images. Using the dataset, we develop a pipeline for processing low-light images, based on end-to-end training of a fully-convolutional network.
